## Intro

I’m Austin, a Lead Software Engineer at [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com), where I help build and scale products that
democratize finance for individuals. The software I’ve worked on has powered billions in transactions, launched new
revenue streams, scaled core systems, and streamlined complex financial operations. Leading a talented engineering team,
I focus on driving innovation at the intersection of web development, data engineering, and AI/ML—most recently pushing
into building AI-first applications.

Before Fundrise, I sharpened my skills at [Travelers](https://travelers.com), working on internal tools, rating
software, and machine learning projects that deepened my technical expertise.

Outside of work, I’m an avid podcast listener, enjoying shows
like [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm), [Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/series/invest-like-the-best/),
and [Onward](https://fundrise.com/investor-update/695/view). I also enjoy listening to music from artists
like [Marsh](https://www.marshmusician.com/), [Above & Beyond](https://www.aboveandbeyond.nu/),
and [Enamour](https://www.enamourmusic.com/).
