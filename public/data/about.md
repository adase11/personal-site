# Intro

I’m Austin, a Lead Software Engineer at [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com), where I've played a key role in building and scaling products that help democratize the financial system for the individual. The software projects I've worked on have powered billions of dollars in transactions and helped launch new revenue streams, scale core systems, and streamline complex financial operations. Leading a talented team of engineers, I focus on driving innovation, particularly in the intersection of web development, data engineering, and AI/ML, with our latest project pushing into new AI-driven solutions.

Before Fundrise, I honed my skills at [Travelers](https://travelers.com), working on internal tools, rating software, and machine learning projects that further deepened my technical expertise.

When I’m not coding or leading teams, I’m an avid listener of podcasts like [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm), [Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/series/invest-like-the-best/),  [Onward](https://fundrise.com/investor-update/695/view), and I love staying ahead of the curve in tech.
