# Intro

I am a Lead Software Engineer at [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com), where I've contributed to building and scaling new products and applications that have facilitated millions and billions of dollars in transactions. Before Fundrise, I gained valuable experience at [Travelers](https://travelers.com), where I focused on rating software, internal tooling development, and machine learning projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to various podcasts like [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm), [Invest Like the Best](https://joincolossus.com/series/invest-like-the-best/), and [Onward](https://fundrise.com/investor-update/695/view), and exploring new technologies. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.
